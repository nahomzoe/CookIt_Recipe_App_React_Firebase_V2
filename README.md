    cookIT-recipe-react-app

# Description

Our food recipe app is built using React and connected to a cloud-based database. With this app, users can easily add and delete their own recipes, making it simple to share and discover new recipe ideas from other users.

# Technologies used

Built with:

    - HTML
    - JS
    - CSS
    - MUI
    - Bootstrap
    - Reactjs
    - Google cloud Firebase function
    - Fire store (NoSql) database.

# Setup and usage

    Deployed and works fine.

    I kindly ask,  when you test the remove button please delete the one that you added not the one already been added. Just to do not empty the database so others can start with some list of recipes when they want to test.
