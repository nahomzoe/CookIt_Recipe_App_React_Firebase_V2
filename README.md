    cookIT-recipe-react-app

# Description

    This is a basic food recipe app made with react and connected to cloud database. It enables users to add, and delete thier own recipes so they can share recipes of each others.

# Technologies used

Built with:

    - HTML
    - JS
    - CSS
    - Bootstrap
    - Reactjs
    - Google cloud Firebase function
    - Fire store (NoSql) database.

# Setup and usage

    Deployed and works fine.

    I kindly ask,  when you test the remove button please delete the one that you added not the one already been added. Just to do not empty the database so others can start with some list of recipes when they want to test.
